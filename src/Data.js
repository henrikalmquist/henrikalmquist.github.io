    about: 
    
`Henrik Almquist is an architect based in Stockholm and Paris. Working with all sets of scale - from an exhibition, to the villa, to the urban block - he approaches a situation with a sensitivity to the site, the people and what is already there. In conjuring an architecture of an open framework, the needs, dreams and functions are left to mediate an ever-expanding and versatile space. 

He holds a Master of Art from ENSA Paris Malaquais and a Bachelor of Science from TU Chalmers in Architecture and Engineering. The professional experience from numerous renowned international offices have been an important training in how technical detailing and precise drawing in all phases are important to clearly formulate the intentions of the architectural vision. Combining all the views - economy, structure, ecology, social, society and culture - the architect creates one coherent oeuvre in a real dialogue with its situation.
