    about: `Architecture is about the city, the collective practice of living together in a complex societal system. The city is about architecture, the small and large interventions of independent objects that constitute a rich and divers whole. Conceiving this, is a play with the contrast of a given situation and the dreams of its inhabitants, looking forward and backwards, proposing a functional strategy above functional.   

Henrik Almquist is a Swedish architect currently practising in Paris at the agency Muoto (2021-). He holds a Master of Architecture from ENSA Paris Malaquais and a Bachelor of Science from Chalmers Tekniska Högskola in Architecture and Engineering. The professional experiences from Muoto and Sou Fujimoto (2017-2019) has been an important training in how technical detailing and precise drawing in all phases are important to clearly formulate the intentions of the architectural vision. Saddling many seats - the economists, the structural engineers, the urbanist - the architect combines all the views into one coherent oeuvre in a real dialogue with its situation. 
    
The two practices and the different perspective from the schools have formed a dual approach on architecture and urbanism. An expanding theoretical conception is backed up by a technical knowledge and a thorough method in the formulation of strategies and the crafting of space. Taking into account what is already there, in terms of the place and the needs of the project, a situated architecture can be imagined and be given form.
