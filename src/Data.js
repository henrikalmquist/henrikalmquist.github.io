            Having not seen any major renovation since its constructions in the 60’s, the whole internal organisation is revised. In opening up between the internal spaces as well as excavating new openings towards the outside, a more generous atmosphere is created – more light, a warmer social environment. Walls are moved, removed and added, finding new uses and enhancing dormant qualities in the building. A room for meditation is extended into the carport, offering a view of a new garden and a calmness in the back of the house.

            Like the country road passes through a village, the visitors are guided into the courtyard framed by the new building and the existing museum. A natural point of arrival and space for events is created. By adding a new workshop, Follo Museum hopes to enhance the visitor’s experience with practical exercise under one roof, a structure of wood, that offers the traditional crafts to express themselves. The flexible use of spaces creates many new possibilities while delicately integrating the new building in the forest, augmenting the sites unique character.

            Relating differently to all sides of the building, the small kiosk activates the public space in opening its shutters. Offering a protection for the passer by or a standing coffee towards the tram, a seated meal in the park or a take-a-away by the busy pedestrian path. The plan also offers the possibility to host different types of programmes, further prolonging the utility and function of the building. The simple and economical wooden structure is built off site and lifted in place.

            Entering the courtyard of Charlottenborg all visitors are struck by the strong presence and activity in the space. A constantly changing landscape full of impressions. More than enough material to create a memorial experience.
            Built from reusable materials, the structure creates an open framework that gives space to what is already there to grow. A sound installation is used to create a sort of collective memory, a social poem, enhancing the experience of the space. The sound from the courtyard is recorded, delayed one day and then replayed in the interior acoustically separated room. 
            This structure aims to create a point of meeting and recreation. Inviting people to have a pause from the hectic festival, meeting up with their friends or give a room for discussion. However, with people soon figuring out the function of the sound installation, it will also become a source of fun and interaction.

            The task lies in interacting with what already exists and to propose a solution of continuity by integrating social values into the economic driven urban regeneration. Acting on the scales of urbanism and architecture, this project proposes a design approach of an active form. By defining a protocol, a new balance is expressed between the three following logics; the specificity of the local practices and their related spaces; the generic city and its market driven urbanisation; the interstitial space that assures a temporality of use.

            Three walls can be totally slid open towards the garden, making the space as much a building as a terrace. In the back an alcove, the traditional tokonoma, defines the rear end of the space. The brick fundaments relate back to the surrounding landscape and seamlessly integrated into the wooden frames; mosquito nets assure a pleasant comfort all around the year.

            The ocean, from where all life derives, has been neglected. In a world of pollution and over consumption trash are piling up on our shores. Most people see it for what it is, a physical manifestation of the global ecological crises. Others see it as a material to understand and to take care of. In a future time, a separate society emerges along our coasts and the strong relation to the ocean gives place for new values and faiths. The gifts from the ocean are sacred. 
            In constructing a utopia based on a different view of what is sacred, the project pushes an ecological narrative of a society that lives and flourish in the ruin, on the consequences, of our society. Everything revolves around the harvesting and the reuse of the found objects, at times instigating large infrastructural projects, at others, inspiring a direct dialogue with the horizon through a simple frame of driftwood.

Almquist Architecture Agency is based between Stockholm and Paris. Working with all sets of scales - from the exhibition space, the villa, to the urban block – the practice approaches a situation with a sensitivity to the site, the people and what is already there. Identifying the key values, dreaming together with the client, the design aims to create something functional above the mere function. This means fully understanding the potential in the given economy of the project, mastering the technical aspects and seeking sustainable approaches in all levels of the process. All this, while making it a place for people. An open and a generous architecture that grows and can evolve over time, creating a space for many purposes and for the beauty of living.

It is in a close dialogue with the needs and vision of the client that a project takes form. The practice approaches every project from its unique position believing there are essential and specific values to be found and enhanced in every one of them. Building new, extending an existing building or redoing an interior, asks for different things but can be dealt with a similar thinking, a similar design. It is about emphasising the most important qualities and leave them to speak for the whole project. The view to the sun flower field, the balcony that becomes part of the kitchen, the table where everyone wants to gather, the light that makes you warm. In order to reach there, it is important to rigorously follow through the whole process, combining a strong vision with a technical and economic knowledge. Closely tied into this know-how of building, an every-expanding library of references and tools are making sure the accustomed way of construction and thinking are adapted for a more sustainable one. A method that assures the project is carefully carried out, at the same times as, it is expanding the possibilities of space.

Henrik Almquist (SAR/MSA) has worked at renowned offices from Stockholm, Paris and Tokyo. Proposing a wide perspective on architecture and urban planning, he has carried out projects from all phases, from early sketches to seeing through the construction phase. A foundation that was also formed by an education in architecture and engineering from Chalmers in Sweden and an explorative and artistic master degree from ENSA Paris-Malaquais in France. Lately Henrik is also teaching at the architecture school of Lund Technical University (LTH).

Collaborations: Morgane Alonzo, Markus Gustafsson, Joel Mattson, Léa Ganteil and Oscar Aparicio.
