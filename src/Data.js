    intro: `
    AAA is working with renovations, additions and regenerative processes. In defining the hidden potential of an existing situation or building, the perception and use of space are altered through simple architectural interventions. It is about finding creative solutions that do more with less. Through the lens of an economic and technical know-how, the present qualities of a building or site are reinterpreted into a new generous and functional space.

            Centrally located in Växjö, the brief asked, what happens with the whole built environement if the hospital moves? 
            We proposed a first phase with three interventions that helps the city to understand how the existing structures can be reused, at the same time, mediating what citizens are expecting. 
            The second phase is a hypothesis of what could be learnt from the site and how that would take form.

            The ocean, from where all life derives, has been neglected. In a world of pollution and over consumption trash are piling up on our shores. Most people see it for what it is, a physical manifestation of the global ecological crises. Others see it as a material to understand and to take care of. In a future time, a separate society emerges along our coasts and the strong relation to the ocean gives place for new values and faiths. The gifts from the ocean are sacred. 
            In constructing a utopia based on a different view of what is sacred, the project pushes an ecological narrative of a society that lives and flourish in the ruin, on the consequences, of our society. Everything revolves around the harvesting and the reuse of the found objects, at times instigating large infrastructural projects, at others, inspiring a direct dialogue with the horizon through a simple frame of driftwood.

Adaptive - a way to see
Every landscape and every building sit on a hidden potential. The key role of an architect is to identify and enhance these qualities. Adapting to every situation, it can implicate a minimal renovation, reusing materials, a small extension or a tailored addition. The same goes for an urban environment, with the right understanding, a simple intervention can hugely impact the activities and atmosphere of a space. 
 
Architecture - a way to build
Shouldering many different perspectives - spatial, cultural, ecologic, economic, technical - a project can build a unified whole. One where all parts are speaking to each other. AAA can offer:
* Development strategy of a building or a site through a regenerative process. How can an existing structure best be put to new use?
* Renovation or addition that adapts to an existing situation. From design, building permit, construction drawings to assuring a smooth construction phase. 

Agency - a way to work
AAA is committed to find strategies and create buildings that harmonise with the environment and the individual needs and aspirations. It is about listening and learning from every specific situation. This means fully understanding the potential in the given economy of the project, mastering the technical aspects and seeking sustainable approaches in all levels of the process.
