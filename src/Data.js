    intro: `
    AAA is an emerging Agency for Adaptive Architecture, working with renovations, additions and regenerative strategies. In defining the hidden potential of an existing situation or building, the perception and use of space are altered through simple architectural interventions. It is about finding creative solutions that do more with less. Through the lens of an economic and technical know-how, weaved together with ecological and cultural considerations, the present qualities are reinterpreted into a generous and functional space.

            Centrally located in Växjö, the brief asked, what happens with the whole built environement if the hospital moves? 
            We proposed a first phase with three interventions that helps the city to understand how the existing structures can be reused, at the same time, mediating what citizens are expecting. 
            The second phase is a hypothesis of what could be learnt from the site and how that would take form.

            The ocean, from where all life derives, has been neglected. In a world of pollution and over consumption trash are piling up on our shores. Most people see it for what it is, a physical manifestation of the global ecological crises. Others see it as a material to understand and to take care of. In a future time, a separate society emerges along our coasts and the strong relation to the ocean gives place for new values and faiths. The gifts from the ocean are sacred. 
            In constructing a utopia based on a different view of what is sacred, the project pushes an ecological narrative of a society that lives and flourish in the ruin, on the consequences, of our society. Everything revolves around the harvesting and the reuse of the found objects, at times instigating large infrastructural projects, at others, inspiring a direct dialogue with the horizon through a simple frame of driftwood.

**Seeing Potential in Every Space**
Every building, every landscape holds a hidden potential. Our role as architects is to recognise and elevate these qualities. Whether it's a single building or a whole urban area, subtle adjustments can create a significant impact, transforming how a space feels and functions. This is what we mean with an Adaptive Architecture. 

**Functional Above Function**
Architecture is a balance of different needs: spatial, cultural, ecological, economic, and technical. We aim to bring these elements together into a unified whole. Our approach includes:

* Regenerative Strategies — How can an existing structure find new life? How can we bring in the voices of the community to shape it? We explore the best way to repurpose what's already there, be it an under performing office block, a neighbourhood derelict of public activity or the empty plot in the village. 

* Adaptive Design — Renovations and additions tailored to the existing situation. It could be a refurbishment of an office or commercial space, the extension of a private home or adding a new building into a delicate context. We handle everything from design and permits to construction, ensuring an inspiring and seamless process.

**Working Together**
We focus on creating designs that harmonise with the environment and respond to the unique needs of each client. Our approach is rooted in listening and learning from each specific situation, understanding each project’s potential and budget. If you would like to know more or discuss a project, please feel free to reach out to contact@a-a-a.se

Is the founder of AAA and brings experience from Stockholm, Paris, and Tokyo. He has carried out projects in all phases, from in-situ dialogues to early design proposals to seeing through the construction. Henrik also teaches architecture at Lund University, directing the masterstudio *The Renewal of Modernism* on renovations and is actively involved in the ongoing dialogue on urban development and sustainability.
