    intro: `Almquist Architecture Agency is based between Stockholm and Paris. Working with all sets of scales – from the exhibition space, the villa, to the urban block – the practice approaches a situation with a sensitivity to the site, the people and what is already there. In conjuring an architecture of an open framework, the needs, dreams and functions are left to mediate an ever-expanding and versatile space.`,

`Henrik Almquist (SAR/MSA) holds a Master of Art from ENSA Paris Malaquais and a Bachelor of Science from TU Chalmers in Architecture and Engineering. The professional experience from numerous renowned international offices have been an important training in how technical detailing and precise drawing in all phases are important to clearly formulate the intentions of the architectural vision. Combining all the views - economy, structure, ecology, social, society and culture - the architect creates one coherent oeuvre in a real dialogue with  its situation.
